Arduino_Temperature_Alarm
====================

An Arduino Temperature Alarm

What is does.  I am making this temperature alarm because I currently do not have central heat and the wall gas heater does not have a thermostat, just low, medium, and high.  My wife and I have a habit of forgetting to turn down the heater before bed and will wake up to a living room at 85 degrees F.  Sometimes it is worse and I have to turn on my air conditioner to cool it down even when it is 20 degrees F outside. This project will set of an alarm and flash a LED when the temp rises above a set temperature.  Go to projects.procknation.com to see the hardware that this code works on.

This is my first project using gitHub so if I am doing something wrong please be kind and let me know what I am doing and how to fix it.

Versions

When I uploaded my code I was at version 2.0 using my owen version conventions.  I will be changing this so that the first usable code with be version 1.0.

1-16-2014.  Uploaded code to github. Resetting version to 0.9 from 2.0 before it was uploaded. This code is still not ready to be used. I am ironing out all the bugs and control structures.  When I release the working version it should be version 1.0.  I will add further comments to this readme when it is ready.

----------------------------a quick add. will be fixed up shortly. please ignore-----------------------------
version history

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!as of 1-16-2014 code not working yet!!!!!!!!!!

version 0.9 1-17-2014
-version change to 0.9 now that added to gitHub. Added my own debounce
code based on previous debounce code only in design and not content.
-Added rework of 'if' decision structure based on hand written code
from graph pad. Source is on project.procknation.com
-Found that the first try at if structure was to complicated. I
simplified the structure to basic boolean decisions.
-Also editing code and comments to make it easier to read.

version 2.0 1-16-2014 
-Changing to 2.0 because this will be a major code redesign. Over
80% of the code will be different all of which will be documented
here or on projects.procknation.com.

-Also removed previous debouce function code 

version 1.8 1-15-2014
Added first try at decision processing stucture and switch debounce.

version 1.7 1-14-2014

version 1.6 1-13-2014

version 1.0 to 1.5 1-10-2014 to 1-12-2014
testing out different sensor inputs and such.  I did this before I was
keeping track of version changes.
