A Mintduino Temperature Alarm

What is does.  I am making this temperature alarm because I currently do not have central heat and the wall gas heater does not have a thermostat, just low, medium, and high.  My wife and I have a habit of forgetting to turn down the heater before bed and will wake up to a living room at 85 degrees F.  Sometimes it is worse and I have to turn on my air conditioner to cool it down even when it is 20 degrees F outside. This project will set of an alarm and flash a LED when the temp rises above a set temperature.  Go to projects.procknation.com to see the hardware that this code works on.

This is my first project using gitHub so if I am doing something wrong please be kind and let me know what I am doing and how to fix it.

Versions

When I uploaded my code I was at version 2.0 using my owen version conventions.  I will be changing this so that the first usable code with be version 1.0.

1-16-2014.  Uploaded code to github. Resetting version to 0.9 from 2.0 before it was uploaded. This code is still not ready to be used. I am ironing out all the bugs and control structures.  When I release the working version it should be version 1.0.  I will add further comments to this readme when it is ready.
