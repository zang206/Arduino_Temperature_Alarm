{"name":"Arduino Temperature Alarm","tagline":"An Arduino Temperature Alarm","body":"# Arduino_Temperature_Alarm\r\n====================\r\n\r\n## An Arduino Temperature Alarm\r\n\r\nWhat is does.  I am making this temperature alarm because I currently do not have central heat and the wall gas heater does not have a thermostat, just low, medium, and high.  My wife and I have a habit of forgetting to turn down the heater before bed and will wake up to a living room at 85 degrees F.  Sometimes it is worse and I have to turn on my air conditioner to cool it down even when it is 20 degrees F outside. This project will set of an alarm and flash a LED when the temp rises above a set temperature.  Go to projects.procknation.com to see the hardware that this code works on.\r\n\r\nThis is my first project using gitHub so if I am doing something wrong please be kind and let me know what I am doing and how to fix it.\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nWhen I uploaded my code I was at version 2.0 using my owen version conventions.  I will be changing this so that the first usable code with be version 1.0.\r\n\r\n1-16-2014.  Uploaded code to github. Resetting version to 0.9 from 2.0 before it was uploaded. This code is still not ready to be used. I am ironing out all the bugs and control structures.  When I release the working version it should be version 1.0.  I will add further comments to this readme when it is ready.\r\n\r\n----------------------------a quick add. will be fixed up shortly. please ignore-----------------------------\r\nversion history\r\n\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!as of 1-16-2014 code not working yet!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n### version 0.9 1-17-2014\r\n-version change to 0.9 now that added to gitHub. Added my own debounce\r\ncode based on previous debounce code only in design and not content.\r\n-Added rework of 'if' decision structure based on hand written code\r\nfrom graph pad. Source is on project.procknation.com\r\n-Found that the first try at if structure was to complicated. I\r\nsimplified the structure to basic boolean decisions.\r\n-Also editing code and comments to make it easier to read.\r\n\r\n### version 2.0 1-16-2014 \r\n-Changing to 2.0 because this will be a major code redesign. Over\r\n80% of the code will be different all of which will be documented\r\nhere or on projects.procknation.com.\r\n\r\n-Also removed previous debouce function code \r\n\r\n### version 1.8 1-15-2014\r\nAdded first try at decision processing stucture and switch debounce.\r\n\r\n### version 1.7 1-14-2014\r\n\r\n### version 1.6 1-13-2014\r\n\r\n### version 1.0 to 1.5 1-10-2014 to 1-12-2014\r\ntesting out different sensor inputs and such.  I did this before I was\r\nkeeping track of version changes.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
